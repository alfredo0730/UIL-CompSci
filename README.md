I have most of the solutions to the problems, though I am missing some. The comments on the solutions assume that you understand what the problem is asking for and
only explain how to implement a solution and why certain things are done.
Even for the problems that aren't done, I have the .dat files so if you try and solve them you can use the .dat sample file to test it.
